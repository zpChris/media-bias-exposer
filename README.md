INTRODUCTION
------------

The No Bias News Chrome Extension takes the bias and "factual reporting" ratings from <a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/">Media Bias Fact Check</a> and displays these in an organized manner, along with other relevant information, when visiting the specific news website.

DISCLAIMER
----------

The source we used for this project (<a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/">Media Bias Fact Check</a>) has their own Chrome extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/official-media-bias-fact/hdcpibgmmcnpjmmenengjgkkfohahegk?hl=en-US">here</a>. Although we determined this while creating No Bias News, our extension still holds additional relevant information that may be interesting to you, the user.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Since this is a Chrome extension, you have to use Google Chrome for the extension to work. Additionally, not all news sites are indexed - however, if you find a site you want Open Lens to add, please contact us at <a href="mailto:research@openlens.net?subject=Add ___ to No Bias News">research@openlens.net</a>.

FAQ
---

**Why should I install this extension?**

In a society increasingly peppered by fake news and biased sources, fact checks and bias reports are essentially required when researching new information. This extension succintly provides the necessary information to understand the news source's perspective and subsequently adapt your interpretation of the reading.

**How is this different than the Official Media Bias Fact Check Extension?**

Aside from the design, we provide more information regarding the news organization than MBFC. However, we have not indexed as many news sources as MBFC, but we are working to expand our database.

**What is Open Lens?**

<a href="https://openlensresearch.wordpress.com/">Open Lens</a> is a student-lead organization that promotes transparency through small tech tools, interviews, and blog posts.

**Who runs Open Lens?**
